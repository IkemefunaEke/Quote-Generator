# Quote-Generator
This is a Quote Generator that displays different quotes randomly written in JavaScript.
It contains an array that has multiple objects. 
The object contains the quote and the person who said the quote.
I use the Math.floor and the Math.random to help display these randomly when the button is clicked.
